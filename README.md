A project for automatically scraping the Wikipedia article,
[United States presidential election, 2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2016),
for the state-level popular vote results, and applying the methodology of my
blog post,
[Fair, Efficient State-wise Electoral College Vote Allocation](https://dalevisser.wordpress.com/2016/12/08/fair-efficient-state-wise-electoral-college-vote-allocation/).
